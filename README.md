# abooter

	A simple bootloader on some Arm architectures.

	I get tired with various bootloader on ARM, and I think a bootloader should be simple enough to use, it does not need too much features.

	So, I decide to write a simple one, on ARM9, and ARM11, for this moment.

	Althought it may be a mistake, but it is worthing.
